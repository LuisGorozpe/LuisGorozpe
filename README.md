### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Luis Enrique Ascencio Gorozpe
#### I am a Data Scientist and a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at [CIMAT](https://www.cimat.mx) 
![I am a Data Scientist and a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at [CIMAT](https://www.cimat.mx) ](https://luisgorozpe.github.io/py-ts-course/images/banner4.png)

My work primarily focuses on probability and statistics. I completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Pure Mathematics in 2021 and my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics in 2017.

Currently, as a Ph.D. candidate at CIMAT, my coursework and research are centered on Probability and Statistics. I have a particular interest in Data Science, Machine Learning, nonlinear statistics, and high-dimensional statistics, with a specific focus on dimensionality reduction techniques.

 My current research interests include nonlinear statistics on Riemannian manifolds, the analysis and modeling of time series, and the study of Data Science and its application for developing Machine Learning and artificial intelligence technologies.


Skills: Math, Time Series, Machine Learning, Statistics, Python, R, Latex, Js, Docker, Git.
